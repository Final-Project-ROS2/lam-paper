The realization of intelligent robots, operating autonomously and interacting with other intelligent agents, human or artificial, requires the integration of environment perception, reasoning, and action.
Classic Artificial Intelligence techniques for this purpose, focusing on \textit{symbolic} approaches, have long-ago hit the scalability wall on compute and memory costs. Advances in Large Language Models in the past decade (\textit{neural} approaches) have resulted in unprecedented displays of capability, at the cost of control, explainability, and interpretability. 
Large Action Models aim at extending Large Language Models to encompass the full perception, reasoning, and action cycle; requiring substantially more comprehensive training and suffering from the same deficiencies.
Here, we show it is possible to build competent Large Action Models using extant building-blocks, and that their control, interpretability, and explainability can be effected by incorporating symbolic wrappers, and associated verification, on their outputs, achieving \textit{neuro-symbolic} solutions for intelligent robots.
Our experiments on a multi-modal robot show a Large Action Model intelligence can be achieved by the composition of compute-efficient smaller models, where action verification and explainability is driven by the generation and verification of Planning Domain Definition Language code.
These results can support practitioners in the design and development of robotic Large Action Models across novel industries, and shed some light on the the ongoing challenges that must be addressed in the field.

\section{Introduction}

Intelligent robots capable of perceiving their surroundings, reasoning about tasks, and executing reliable actions are increasingly essential in engineering, manufacturing, and everyday collaborative settings. Their potential impact lies not only in automating repetitive labor, but in enabling fluid human–robot collaboration where robots understand user intent, adapt to changing environments, and provide transparent, verifiable reasoning. Achieving this, however, requires solving the longstanding integration problem: connecting perception, language, symbolic reasoning, and physical control into a coherent system.

\par Classic \textit{symbolic} AI approaches offer strong guarantees on correctness, interpretability, and verification, but scale poorly with the complexity and variability of real-world environments~\cite{tamp, recent-trends-in-tamp}. Conversely, \textit{neural} methods, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), excel at perception, abstraction, and generalization, but struggle with controllability, reliability, and the prevention of hallucinations~\cite{eval-application-challenges-llms}. These limitations hinder their deployment in safety-critical robotic systems, where incorrect reasoning can lead to dangerous actions~\cite{plangenllm}.

\par Large Action Models (LAMs) have recently emerged as a potential solution to this integration gap. Defined as agents trained on large-scale offline datasets via causal sequence modeling, LAMs aim to extend the generalization capabilities of LLMs from text generation to active physical task completion~\cite{lram}. However, relying on massive end-to-end models presents distinct challenges. First, existing LAMs are primarily based on Transformer architectures, which suffer from quadratic inference complexity; this high latency is often prohibitive for real-time robotic control~\cite{lram}. Second, unlike textual hallucinations, errors in action execution ("action hallucinations") can lead to irreversible physical damage and safety hazards~\cite{lam}. Consequently, a major open question is whether it is possible to construct practical LAMs that are computationally efficient, safe, and explainable without the resource-intensive training of massive new sequence models.

\par In this work, we propose that competent LAM intelligence can be achieved by the composition of compute-efficient smaller models, where action verification is driven by symbolic logic. Specifically, this paper offers the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{We describe a modular architecture that achieves LAM capabilities by augmenting LLMs with extant perception models.} By integrating pre-trained vision models (such as SAM and CLIP) to provide the LLM with grounded perception, we demonstrate a method to build competent action models without the need for additional training. This approach not only avoids the costs of end-to-end training but also renders the system's perceptual capabilities more extendable.
  \item \textbf{We introduce a mechanism for control and explainability via PDDL generation.} We show that by treating the LLM as a "modeler" that generates Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) code, we can enforce symbolic verification on the robot's output, ensuring actions are logically sound before execution.
  \item \textbf{We validate this hypothesis through a prototype engineering assistant.} We provide experimental evidence on a Universal Robots (UR) arm, demonstrating that this composite approach successfully grounds natural language commands into safe, interpretable physical actions.
\end{itemize}

\section{Composing Large Action Model Architectures for Intelligent Robots}\label{sec:arch}

\subsection{LAM componentization}

We propose a modular, neuro-symbolic architecture that functions as a comprehensive Large Action Model (LAM). Rather than relying on a single, opaque neural network, our system is composed of specialized functional modules that integrate perception, reasoning, and action. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture_overview}, the architecture is defined by a hierarchical planning pipeline driven by multi-modal inputs.

    \Description{System Architecture Overview}{System Architecture Overview. The framework connects high-level cognitive reasoning with deterministic motion control through a stratified planning hierarchy.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Multi-modal Inputs.}
The system's awareness is driven by two perception modules. The \textit{Perception Module} employs a variety of open-vocabulary foundation models to perform object segmentation, classification, and grasp synthesis. This converts raw pixel data into a useful information without requiring task-specific training. Simultaneously, the \textit{Speech Module} utilizes a neural speech-to-text engine to capture user intent. This interface includes a symbolic override mechanism, where specific safety keywords (e.g., ``Stop'') bypass the reasoning layers to trigger immediate hardware halts.

\textbf{Hierarchical Planning Core.}
To bridge the gap between abstract natural language and precise robot motor control, we implement a three-tier planning hierarchy. This structure ensures that high-level reasoning is grounded in valid physical capabilities.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High-Level Reasoning (The Cognitive Agent):} At the top of the hierarchy, the system interprets user commands by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), generating a structured sequence of subtasks or actions.
    
    \item \textbf{Medium-Level Orchestration (The Translator):} This layer acts as an intermediary, treating the robot's capabilities as callable ``tools.'' It decomposes the high-level subtasks into specific action sequences if needed. This layer manages the flow of execution and facilitates dynamic feedback between the planner and the perception modules.
    
    \item \textbf{Low-Level Execution (The Controller):} The foundation of the hierarchy is the motion control core. It handles path planning, trajectory generation, and collision avoidance. This layer exposes interfaces for Cartesian and joint-space control, ensuring that the abstract plans received from above are executed with kinematic precision and adherence to safety constraints.
\end{itemize}

This stratified design allows the robot to benefit from the flexibility of modern Generative AI while maintaining the reliability and safety essential for physical interaction.
